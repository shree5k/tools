Direct and Clear
Our priorities are to educate our users about our products without confusing them.

Concise and simple
If it’s a battle between concise and sounding better, choose concise.

Universal
To write in a more inclusive and gender-neutral way.

Above all, usability should be the core principle. Copy should help users accomplish the task at hand more than how it made them feel while doing so. 

Tone of a voice is not about what you say, but rather the way that you say it, and the impression it makes on everyone who reads or hears you. The right tone depends on the user’s contextual needs and corresponding emotions for that experience, as well as how involved and emotional we need to be in the process.
we try to be casual, conversational and moderately enthusiastic in order to establish the human-connect.

Is this my interface or yours?
“My” point of view

By using “my” in an interface, it implies that the product is an extension of the user. It’s as if the product is labeling things on behalf of the user. “My” feels personal. It feels like you can customize and control it.

“Your” point of view
By using “your” in an interface, it implies that the product is talking with you. It’s almost as if the product is your personal assistant, helping you get something done. “Here’s your music. Here are your orders.”

When to be neutral: Try to be neutral wherever possible to reduce the  complexity of using me and you in the UI.

When to use you: Use you or your when your product is asking questions, giving instructions, or describing things to the user. Just imagine what a personal assistant might say.
Tray titles

When to use me: Use I, me, my, or mine when the user is interacting with the product, like clicking a button or selecting a checkbox. We can use ‘I’ or ‘My’ when we need to highlight the user’s ownership of their actions.

Letter casing helps in establishing a hierarchy in the flow of information and to condition users’ minds to perceive copy in specific ways.

Recommended Letter cases

Title case — Capitalize the First Letter of Every Word in a Sentence Except the Articles (a, an, the), Conjunctions (and, but, or), and Propositions (on, in, with).

Sentence case — Capitalize only the first letter of a sentence and the proper nouns.

Uppercase — CAPITALIZE EVERY LETTER.
Title case  

The title case helps to bring a hierarchy between text elements in a write-up or on a page, such as titles and descriptions.

Sentence case

In sentence case, the first letter of a sentence and the proper nouns capitalized. It’s considered the most readable form of text. Capitalizing the first letter of a sentence serves almost the same purpose as a period (.) at the end of every sentence — to convey the end of a sentence and the beginning of another.

Places to use Sentence case - descriptions, help text, sub-text, long titles.

Uppercase  

Uppercase letters are harder to read because of the lack of legibility (the ability to distinguish between individual letters) — when a statement appears in uppercase, each letter is the same height, so it’s harder to tell one letter from the other.

Period

In general, if the text is a full sentence, add a period to the end. Use only one space after a period. 

Avoid periods in headers, titles, tooltips, help text (single line), bulleted lists and menu names. 

Commas & Colons

Use commas when writing a list. If you are not sure, read out the sentence loud. Wherever you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.

Colons are used in sentences to show that something is following, like an example or a list.

Use only one space after colon or comma.

Date strings should never be localised manually by a translator as time and date strings should be tied to a user’s locale (country and language).

Usually, the date comes before the month, then followed by the year. On the 8th day of the month of January, in the year 2020, then the date can be written as:
8 Jan
8 Jan 2020
Monday, 8 Jan 2020
Use numbers to give a clearer expression of time. Use a colon between the hours and minutes with no spaces on either side.

If the time zone is absolute, use the common name, like IST [Indian standard time] or PT [Pacific time]. Do not use UTC formulas.

Example - 3:30:51 pm IST
Player Time: 1:20:20
Content Duration: 1h 30m
Content Left: 20m Remaining
Hyphens

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.

Examples:

2019-2021
Mon-Fri
Contractions

Use commonly understood contractions to keep sentences from feeling out-of-touch, robotic, or overly formal.

Contractions can get tricky when it comes to translation.
Abbreviations and Acronyms

Its good to avoid unless they’re widely known and accepted, like days of the week (Sat, Sun). Don’t use ampersands in body text or most headers, unless they’re part of a company name, title, or other proper noun.

Exception: To save space, you can use ampersands in navigation, tweets, and chart and table headers.
We might face a challenge as most screen readers do not recognise abbreviations and acronyms, and generally read them as if they were typical English words.
Parentheses

Use parentheses in pairs to provide examples, or to provide an abbreviation. Use parentheses across the UI. Parentheses can be used to clarify ambiguous words or provide missing words that are essential for understanding clearly.
Brackets

Use square brackets [ ] to insert text inside quotes. Square brackets are to be used in subtitles.

Links

Links allow users to navigate to a different location. They can be presented inline inside a paragraph or as standalone text. Links should provide information on the associated action or destination. Try to avoid “click here” or “learn more.”


When possible, avoid gendered pronouns. If you can't, then they or their is preferable to his or her or he or she.
